NAME
    Dancer::Serializer::UUEncode - UU Encoding serializer for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        # in your Dancer app:
        setting serializer => 'UUEncode';

        # or in your Dancer config file:
        serializer: 'UUEncode'

DESCRIPTION
    This serializer serializes your data structure to UU Encoding. Since UU
    Encoding is just encoding and not a serialization format, it first
    freezes it using Storable and only then serializes it.

    It uses Storable's "nfreeze" and "thaw" functions.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

    An initializer that is called automatically by Dancer.

    Runs "loaded".

  deserialize
    Deserializes a given data from UU encoding after thawing it with
    Storable.
